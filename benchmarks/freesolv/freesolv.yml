# The Free Energy of Solvation (FreeSolv) Dataset, as described in:
# https://doi.org/10.1007/s10822-014-9747-x
#
# Download the data from the GitHub:
# https://github.com/MobleyLab/FreeSolv/blob/master/database.txt
# Then run: python parse.py > benchmark_data.csv
# to prepare the data for fastprop.
#
# Additional Comments:
# Goal is ~1 kcal/mol RMSE.
