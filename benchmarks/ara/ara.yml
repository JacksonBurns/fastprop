# The Androgen Receptor Antagonist (ARA) Dataset, as described in:
# https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-023-00721-z
#
# To reproduce the complete data workflow, do this:
# Download the csv file from the author's GitHub:
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plenoi/DeepAR/main/dataset/AR.csv
# find-and-replace activate/inactive with 1/0,
# and rename it to benchmark_data.csv.
#
# Additional Comments:
# Reference paper at the top achieved an accuracy of 0.911 and an AUC
# of 0.945 via a complex modeling strategy.
#
# for comparison to Chemprop, see chemprop_ara.sh
# the data for Chemprop was prepared using csvtool (you could also use excel)
