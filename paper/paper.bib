        abstract  ="Prediction of chemical bioactivity and physical properties has been one of the most important applications of statistical and more recently{,} machine learning and artificial intelligence methods in chemical sciences. This field of research{,} broadly known as quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) modeling{,} has developed many important algorithms and has found a broad range of applications in physical organic and medicinal chemistry in the past 55+ years. This Perspective summarizes recent technological advances in QSAR modeling but it also highlights the applicability of algorithms{,} modeling methods{,} and validation practices developed in QSAR to a wide range of research areas outside of traditional QSAR boundaries including synthesis planning{,} nanotechnology{,} materials science{,} biomaterials{,} and clinical informatics. As modern research methods generate rapidly increasing amounts of data{,} the knowledge of robust data-driven modelling methods professed within the QSAR field can become essential for scientists working both within and outside of chemical research. We hope that this contribution highlighting the generalizable components of QSAR modeling will serve to address this challenge."

    abstract = "{Within drug discovery, the goal of AI scientists and cheminformaticians is to help identify molecular starting points that will develop into safe and efficacious drugs while reducing costs, time and failure rates. To achieve this goal, it is crucial to represent molecules in a digital format that makes them machine-readable and facilitates the accurate prediction of properties that drive decision-making. Over the years, molecular representations have evolved from intuitive and human-readable formats to bespoke numerical descriptors and fingerprints, and now to learned representations that capture patterns and salient features across vast chemical spaces. Among these, sequence-based and graph-based representations of small molecules have become highly popular. However, each approach has strengths and weaknesses across dimensions such as generality, computational cost, inversibility for generative applications and interpretability, which can be critical in informing practitioners’ decisions. As the drug discovery landscape evolves, opportunities for innovation continue to emerge. These include the creation of molecular representations for high-value, low-data regimes, the distillation of broader biological and chemical knowledge into novel learned representations and the modeling of up-and-coming therapeutic modalities.}",

Graph neural networks, especially message passing neural network (MPNN) and its variants, have recently made remarkable achievements in molecular graph modeling. Albeit powerful, the one-sided focuses on atom (node) or bond (edge) information of existing MPNN methods lead to the insufficient representations of the attributed molecular graphs. Herein, we propose a Communicative Message Passing Neural Network (CMPNN) to improve the molecular embedding by strengthening the message interactions between nodes and edges through a communicative kernel. In addition, the message generation process is enriched by introducing a new message booster module. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed model obtained superior performances against state-of-the-art baselines on six chemical property datasets. Further visualization also showed better representation capacity of our model.},

        abstract = {Machine learning has proven to be a powerful tool for accelerating biofuel development. Although numerous models are available to predict a range of properties using chemical descriptors, there is a trade-off between interpretability and performance. Neural networks provide predictive models with high accuracy at the expense of some interpretability, while simpler models such as linear regression often lack in accuracy. In addition to model architecture, feature selection is also critical for developing interpretable and accurate predictive models. We present a method for systematically selecting molecular descriptor features and developing interpretable machine learning models without sacrificing accuracy. Our method simplifies the process of selecting features by reducing feature multicollinearity and enables discoveries of new relationships between global properties and molecular descriptors. To demonstrate our approach, we developed models for predicting melting point, boiling point, flash point, yield sooting index, and net heat of combustion with the help of the Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT). For training, we used publicly available experimental data for up to 8351 molecules. Our models accurately predict various molecular properties for organic molecules (mean absolute percent error (MAPE) ranges from 3.3% to 10.5%) and provide a set of features that are well-correlated to the property. This method enables researchers to explore sets of features that significantly contribute to the prediction of the property, offering new scientific insights. To help accelerate early stage biofuel research and development, we also integrated the data and models into a open-source, interactive web tool.}

Given the black-box nature of typical neural network based models, uncertainty quantification (UQ) is critical to ensure the reliability of predictions as well as the training datasets, and for a principled quantification of noise and its various sources. Deep learning surrogate models for predicting properties of chemical compounds and mixtures have been recently shown to be promising for enabling data-driven fuel design and optimization, with the ultimate goal of improving efficiency and lowering emissions from combustion engines. In this study, UQ is performed for a multi-task deep learning model that simultaneously predicts the research octane number (RON), Motor Octane Number (MON), and Yield Sooting Index (YSI) of pure components and multicomponent blends. The deep learning model is comprised of three smaller networks: Extractor 1, Extractor 2, and Predictor, and a mixing operator. The molecular fingerprints of individual components are encoded via Extractor 1 and Extractor 2, the mixing operator generates fingerprints for mixtures/blends based on linear mixing operation, and the predictor maps the fingerprint to the target properties. Two different classes of UQ methods, Monte Carlo ensemble methods and Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), are employed for quantifying the epistemic uncertainty. Combinations of Bernoulli and Gaussian distributions with DropConnect and DropOut techniques are explored as ensemble methods. All the DropConnect, DropOut and Bayesian layers are applied to the predictor network. Aleatoric uncertainty is modeled by assuming that each data point has an independent uncertainty associated with it. The results of the UQ study are further analyzed to compare the performance of BNN and ensemble methods. Although this study is confined to UQ of fuel property prediction, the methodologies are applicable to other deep learning frameworks that are being widely used in the combustion community.}

Our method extends the iterative approach to take into account second-order relationships between labels. Obtained results are evaluated using statistical properties of obtained strata as presented by Sechidis. We also propose new statistical measures relevant to second-order quality: label pairs distribution, the percentage of label pairs without positive evidence in folds and label pair - fold pairs that have no positive evidence for the label pair. We verify the impact of new methods on classification performance of Binary Relevance, Label Powerset and a fast greedy community detection based label space partitioning classifier. The proposed approach lowers the variance of classification quality, improves label pair oriented measures and example distribution while maintaining a competitive quality in label-oriented measures. We also witness an increase in stability of network characteristics.}

It is freely available via GitHub. Mordred can be easily installed and used in the command line interface, as a web application, or as a high-flexibility Python package on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, and macOS). Performance benchmark results show that Mordred is at least twice as fast as the well-known PaDEL-Descriptor and it can calculate descriptors for large molecules, which cannot be accomplished by other software.

        abstract={Drug resistance represents a major obstacle to therapeutic innovations and is a prevalent feature in prostate cancer (PCa). Androgen receptors (ARs) are the hallmark therapeutic target for prostate cancer modulation and AR antagonists have achieved great success. However, rapid emergence of resistance contributing to PCa progression is the ultimate burden of their long-term usage. Hence, the discovery and development of AR antagonists with capability to combat the resistance, remains an avenue for further exploration. Therefore, this study proposes a novel deep learning (DL)-based hybrid framework, named DeepAR, to accurately and rapidly identify AR antagonists by using only the SMILES notation. Specifically, DeepAR is capable of extracting and learning the key information embedded in AR antagonists. Firstly, we established a benchmark dataset by collecting active and inactive compounds against AR from the ChEMBL database. Based on this dataset, we developed and optimized a collection of baseline models by using a comprehensive set of well-known molecular descriptors and machine learning algorithms. Then, these baseline models were utilized for creating probabilistic features. Finally, these probabilistic features were combined and used for the construction of a meta-model based on a one-dimensional convolutional neural network. Experimental results indicated that DeepAR is a more accurate and stable approach for identifying AR antagonists in terms of the independent test dataset, by achieving an accuracy of 0.911 and MCC of 0.823. In addition, our proposed framework is able to provide feature importance information by leveraging a popular computational approach, named SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). In the meanwhile, the characterization and analysis of potential AR antagonist candidates were achieved through the SHAP waterfall plot and molecular docking. The analysis inferred that N-heterocyclic moieties, halogenated substituents, and a cyano functional group were significant determinants of potential AR antagonists. Lastly, we implemented an online web server by using DeepAR (at http://pmlabstack.pythonanywhere.com/DeepAR). We anticipate that DeepAR could be a useful computational tool for community-wide facilitation of AR candidates from a large number of uncharacterized compounds.},

        abstract={Hyperparameter optimization is very frequently employed in machine learning. However, an optimization of a large space of parameters could result in overfitting of models. In recent studies on solubility prediction the authors collected seven thermodynamic and kinetic solubility datasets from different data sources. They used state-of-the-art graph-based methods and compared models developed for each dataset using different data cleaning protocols and hyperparameter optimization. In our study we showed that hyperparameter optimization did not always result in better models, possibly due to overfitting when using the same statistical measures. Similar results could be calculated using pre-set hyperparameters, reducing the computational effort by around 10,000 times. We also extended the previous analysis by adding a representation learning method based on Natural Language Processing of smiles called Transformer CNN. We show that across all analyzed sets using exactly the same protocol, Transformer CNN provided better results than graph-based methods for 26 out of 28 pairwise comparisons by using only a tiny fraction of time as compared to other methods. Last but not least we stressed the importance of comparing calculation results using exactly the same statistical measures.},

Using a CharNN [2] architecture upon the embeddings results in higher quality interpretable QSAR/QSPR models on diverse benchmark datasets including regression and classification tasks. The proposed Transformer-CNN method uses SMILES augmentation for training and inference, and thus the prognosis is based on an internal consensus. That both the augmentation and transfer learning are based on embeddings allows the method to provide good results for small datasets. We discuss the reasons for such effectiveness and draft future directions for the development of the method. The source code and the embeddings needed to train a QSAR model are available on https://github.com/bigchem/transformer-cnn. The repository also has a standalone program for QSAR prognosis which calculates individual atoms contributions, thus interpreting the model's result.

As a matter of fact, object representation by means of graphs has a number of advantages over feature vectors. Therefore, various algorithms for graph based machine learning have been proposed in the literature. However, in contrast with the emerging interest in graph based representation, a lack of standardized graph data sets for benchmarking can be observed. Common practice is that researchers use their own data sets, and this behavior cumbers the objective evaluation of the proposed methods. In order to make the different approaches in graph based machine learning better comparable, the present paper aims at introducing a repository of graph data sets and corresponding benchmarks, covering a wide spectrum of different applications.",

At the same time, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) recorded during clinical trials are an important source of human phenotypic data. It is therefore essential to combine data on drugs, targets and side effects into a more complete picture of the therapeutic mechanism of actions of drugs and the ways in which they cause adverse reactions. To this end, we have created the SIDER (‘Side Effect Resource’, http://sideeffects.embl.de) database of drugs and ADRs. The current release, SIDER 4, contains data on 1430 drugs, 5880 ADRs and 140 064 drug-ADR pairs, which is an increase of 40\\% compared to the previous version. For more fine-grained analyses, we extracted the frequency with which side effects occur from the package inserts. This information is available for 39\\% of drug-ADR pairs, 19\\% of which can be compared to the frequency under placebo treatment. SIDER furthermore contains a data set of drug indications, extracted from the package inserts using Natural Language Processing. These drug indications are used to reduce the rate of false positives by identifying medical terms that do not correspond to ADRs.}",
