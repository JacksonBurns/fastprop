        abstract = {Constructing proper representations of molecules lies at the core of numerous tasks such as molecular property prediction and drug design. Graph neural networks, especially message passing neural network (MPNN) and its variants, have recently made remarkable achievements in molecular graph modeling. Albeit powerful, the one-sided focuses on atom (node) or bond (edge) information of existing MPNN methods lead to the insufficient representations of the attributed molecular graphs. Herein, we propose a Communicative Message Passing Neural Network (CMPNN) to improve the molecular embedding by strengthening the message interactions between nodes and edges through a communicative kernel. In addition, the message generation process is enriched by introducing a new message booster module. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed model obtained superior performances against state-of-the-art baselines on six chemical property datasets. Further visualization also showed better representation capacity of our model.},

        abstract = {Machine learning has proven to be a powerful tool for accelerating biofuel development. Although numerous models are available to predict a range of properties using chemical descriptors, there is a trade-off between interpretability and performance. Neural networks provide predictive models with high accuracy at the expense of some interpretability, while simpler models such as linear regression often lack in accuracy. In addition to model architecture, feature selection is also critical for developing interpretable and accurate predictive models. We present a method for systematically selecting molecular descriptor features and developing interpretable machine learning models without sacrificing accuracy. Our method simplifies the process of selecting features by reducing feature multicollinearity and enables discoveries of new relationships between global properties and molecular descriptors. To demonstrate our approach, we developed models for predicting melting point, boiling point, flash point, yield sooting index, and net heat of combustion with the help of the Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT). For training, we used publicly available experimental data for up to 8351 molecules. Our models accurately predict various molecular properties for organic molecules (mean absolute percent error (MAPE) ranges from 3.3% to 10.5%) and provide a set of features that are well-correlated to the property. This method enables researchers to explore sets of features that significantly contribute to the prediction of the property, offering new scientific insights. To help accelerate early stage biofuel research and development, we also integrated the data and models into a open-source, interactive web tool.}

        abstract={Drug resistance represents a major obstacle to therapeutic innovations and is a prevalent feature in prostate cancer (PCa). Androgen receptors (ARs) are the hallmark therapeutic target for prostate cancer modulation and AR antagonists have achieved great success. However, rapid emergence of resistance contributing to PCa progression is the ultimate burden of their long-term usage. Hence, the discovery and development of AR antagonists with capability to combat the resistance, remains an avenue for further exploration. Therefore, this study proposes a novel deep learning (DL)-based hybrid framework, named DeepAR, to accurately and rapidly identify AR antagonists by using only the SMILES notation. Specifically, DeepAR is capable of extracting and learning the key information embedded in AR antagonists. Firstly, we established a benchmark dataset by collecting active and inactive compounds against AR from the ChEMBL database. Based on this dataset, we developed and optimized a collection of baseline models by using a comprehensive set of well-known molecular descriptors and machine learning algorithms. Then, these baseline models were utilized for creating probabilistic features. Finally, these probabilistic features were combined and used for the construction of a meta-model based on a one-dimensional convolutional neural network. Experimental results indicated that DeepAR is a more accurate and stable approach for identifying AR antagonists in terms of the independent test dataset, by achieving an accuracy of 0.911 and MCC of 0.823. In addition, our proposed framework is able to provide feature importance information by leveraging a popular computational approach, named SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). In the meanwhile, the characterization and analysis of potential AR antagonist candidates were achieved through the SHAP waterfall plot and molecular docking. The analysis inferred that N-heterocyclic moieties, halogenated substituents, and a cyano functional group were significant determinants of potential AR antagonists. Lastly, we implemented an online web server by using DeepAR (at http://pmlabstack.pythonanywhere.com/DeepAR). We anticipate that DeepAR could be a useful computational tool for community-wide facilitation of AR candidates from a large number of uncharacterized compounds.},

As a matter of fact, object representation by means of graphs has a number of advantages over feature vectors. Therefore, various algorithms for graph based machine learning have been proposed in the literature. However, in contrast with the emerging interest in graph based representation, a lack of standardized graph data sets for benchmarking can be observed. Common practice is that researchers use their own data sets, and this behavior cumbers the objective evaluation of the proposed methods. In order to make the different approaches in graph based machine learning better comparable, the present paper aims at introducing a repository of graph data sets and corresponding benchmarks, covering a wide spectrum of different applications.",

At the same time, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) recorded during clinical trials are an important source of human phenotypic data. It is therefore essential to combine data on drugs, targets and side effects into a more complete picture of the therapeutic mechanism of actions of drugs and the ways in which they cause adverse reactions. To this end, we have created the SIDER (‘Side Effect Resource’, http://sideeffects.embl.de) database of drugs and ADRs. The current release, SIDER 4, contains data on 1430 drugs, 5880 ADRs and 140 064 drug–ADR pairs, which is an increase of 40\\% compared to the previous version. For more fine-grained analyses, we extracted the frequency with which side effects occur from the package inserts. This information is available for 39\\% of drug–ADR pairs, 19\\% of which can be compared to the frequency under placebo treatment. SIDER furthermore contains a data set of drug indications, extracted from the package inserts using Natural Language Processing. These drug indications are used to reduce the rate of false positives by identifying medical terms that do not correspond to ADRs.}",
