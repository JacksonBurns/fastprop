# This file shows and describes the configurable options for fastprop, but is not itself
# a runnable file. See the `benchmarks` directory for runnable example files.


# Generic Metadata
#
# Directory for output files (cached descriptors, logs, etc.)
output_directory: /path/to/output/dir
# Random seed to control torch as well as data sampling
random_seed: 42
# Type of problem (can be regression or one of these classification types: binary, multiclass, multilabel)
problem_type: regression
# Source of data
input_file: /path/to/data.csv
# Header for column containing targets values (specify multiple with a space in between)
target_columns: lipohilicity permittivity
# Header for column containing SMILES strings
smiles_column: smiles
# run hyperparameter optimization
optimize: False # True
# This will overwrite hidden_size and fnn_layers!

# Featurization
#
# Which set of descriptors to calculate (either all or optimized)
descriptor_set: all
# Call rdMolStandardize.Cleanup on molecules before calculating descriptors
standardize: False
# Allow caching of descriptors
enable_cache: True
#
# or
#
# Provide your own descriptors or those calculated by mordredcommunity from its CLI
precomputed: /path/to/precomputed/descriptors.csv
